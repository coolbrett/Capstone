# Capstone
This repository is home to our Capstone assignment. 
Our goals for this project are to build an interactive website that visualizes our dataset which we will store in a graph database. 
Tools we are using are Reactjs, Neo4j, and the data visualization library titled 'D3'.


#Purpose 
The purpose of this project is to take the IMDb's 2016 Top 1000 movies and create a visualization
tool allowing users to query the dataset to narrow down the display.


#Setup (Using Webstorm)
1a. Create a new project using React
1b. Wait for it to load all the dependencies
2. While waiting go to the github, hit the green "Code" button, and copy the HTTPS link.
3. On the top left click on "Git"
4. At the bottom click "Clone"
5. Paste the copied link from step 2 into the URL box.
6. Hit submit
7. A warning will show in the bottom left. Click "Run 'npm install'"
8. Upon loading, on the left side there is a tab called "Project" that's vertical, click that
8b. That's how you can view the code. It's in my-app/src/components
9. After everything is installed, at the bottom click "Terminal" and type "npm start" to load the GUI
10. The GUI will open into the most recent browser tab you were on.
11. Make sure the database is on in order to perform queries.


#Setup (Neo4j)
1. Go to "https://neo4j.com/download/" and download the Desktop version. This only works on desktop because of security limitations.
2. 



#Notes
This is a work in progress. There are some features that act finicky at times. 
For example after performing a new query the webpage has to be refreshed
in order to properly view the bar graphs, or to perform a query the submit/reset button must be clicked multiple times.
